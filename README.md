## GitHub Project Summary: Sustainable Property Insurance Model**

**Project Overview**
In response to the escalating crisis of extreme-weather events and their impact on property insurance, our team, consisting of three dedicated students, has developed a comprehensive model aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the property insurance industry amidst the challenges posed by climate change. Our project addresses the urgent need for insurance models that can adapt to the rising rates of natural disasters, offering a viable solution for both insurers and property owners worldwide.

**Problem Statement**
The insurance industry is facing unprecedented challenges due to the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, fueled by climate change. With over $1 trillion in damages from more than 1,000 extreme-weather events in recent years, and a 115% increase in claims for natural disasters in 2022 compared to the 30-year average, there's a pressing need for a model that can guide insurance companies on underwriting policies sustainably. The project explores under what conditions insurance companies should underwrite policies and how property owners can influence this decision, aiming to bridge the insurance protection gap and ensure the long-term health of insurance companies.

**Solution Approach**
Our group has crafted an interactive Python model capable of assessing structural risks and recommending proactive measures for protecting culturally significant landmarks. The model provides insurance companies with a tool to determine if they should underwrite policies in areas experiencing a rise in extreme weather events. It also offers insights into how and where communities and property developers should build to ensure resilience and sustainability.

**Implementation and Findings**
We applied our model to two distinct areas on different continents, both prone to extreme weather events, demonstrating the model's global applicability and effectiveness. Our analysis led to the development of a preservation model for community leaders, guiding them on protecting buildings of cultural, historical, economic, or community significance. The project includes a case study where we applied both the insurance and preservation models to assess the value of a historic landmark, providing a detailed plan, timeline, and cost proposal for its future protection.

**Deliverables**
One-Page Summary: Concisely describes our approach and key conclusions.
Table of Contents: Organizes the report for easy navigation.
Complete Solution: Detailed documentation of our model development and analysis.
Community Letter: A one-page recommendation for a community's landmark preservation.
AI Use Report: Reflects on the role of AI in our project, ensuring ethical and responsible use.

**Conclusion**
Our project contributes a vital tool for the insurance industry, offering a way forward in the face of climate change-induced challenges. By integrating risk assessment with proactive measures, we pave the way for more sustainable property insurance and preservation practices, ensuring the protection of invaluable cultural landmarks and the viability of insurance in changing climates.
